/**
 * A class that manages and provides access to the currently active activity in the application.
 * It is registered as an {@link Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks} to keep track of the
 * active activity throughout the lifecycle of the app.
 * <p>
 * This class allows non-activity or non-fragment classes to get the current activity and interact
 * with it (e.g., to register actions or access UI components), which is particularly useful
 * for actions like displaying UI components or handling certain activity-specific logic in classes
 * that are not directly tied to the activity lifecycle.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>For example, it allows other components, such as a photo picker, to know which activity is
 * currently visible and use that context to perform operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>It listens to the applicationâ€™s lifecycle events and updates the reference to the current
 * activity accordingly.</p>
